# MedSeg

Medical image segmentation toolkit based on PaddlePaddle framework. Our target is to implement various 2D and 3D model architectures, various loss function and data augmentation methods. This is still a work in progress but it has achieved good results on the task liver segmentationa and aorta segmentation. The development plans can be seen in the [Project](https://github.com/davidlinhl/medSeg/projects/1)
